## My process

Used two divs inside a container div, one for the image and the other for all the text. the parent div displayed as grid of two columns and one row in desktop env but in mobil env it did have two rows and one column.
the image was as a background for the first div. for the second div i used flexbox to range the text.

### What I learned

even it is a simple exercice but because of it i know now when i should use grid and when i should use flexbox.
